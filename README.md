# Xiric

Xiric is a toy programming language I’m building from scratch to learn how programming languages work under the hood.  
It includes its own **lexer, parser, and interpreter**, all written in Python.

---

## ✨ Features (current / planned)

- ✅ Custom lexer with tokenization for numbers, operators, and parentheses  
- ✅ Basic error handling (illegal characters, line/column tracking)  
- ✅ Integer and float support  
- 🔄 Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
- 🔄 Planned: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and more  

---

## 📂 File Extensions

- `.xrc` → Xiric source code files  

---

## ⚡ Example

```xrc
1 + 2 * (3 - 4)
````

---

## 🛠️ Running Xiric

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jai-git4208/Xiric.git
cd Xiric
```

Run the shell:

```bash

python3 shell.py
```

## 🎯 Goals

Xiric is not meant to compete with production languages — it’s an **educational project** to explore how languages are built, from tokenization to interpretation.
The long-term vision is to gradually add more language features and see how far it can go 🚀.
